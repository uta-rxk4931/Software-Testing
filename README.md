# Software Testing Project

This project demonstrates basic principles of software testing through a Java-based case study. It includes unit tests for a program called `Printtokens`, along with a code coverage report generated using JaCoCo.

## How It Works

- `Printtokens.java`: Contains a sample lexical analyzer or tokenizer implementation.
- `PrinttokensTest.java`: JUnit-based test cases to validate the functionality of Printtokens.
- JaCoCo: Used to generate detailed HTML reports of code coverage from test execution.
- `Solutions.pdf`: Contains written solutions or questions related to software testing methods applied.

## How to View Coverage

1. Open `Software Testing/index.html` in a web browser.
2. Navigate through the folders and files to explore line-by-line test coverage.
3. Red lines indicate uncovered code; green lines indicate fully tested sections.
